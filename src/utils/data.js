It integrates with external services to fetch Playstore reviews, processes them through sentiment analysis, and exposes the results to the frontend. Core backend features include secure JWT-based authentication, review data aggregation, sentiment classification, large data store for all reviews, and role-based access for admins and users. This project aims to provide actionable insights from user reviews to improve app quality and customer satisfaction.
